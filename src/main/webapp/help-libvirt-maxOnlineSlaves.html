		Maximum number of virtual machines that this Hypervisor should use concurrently. A value of 0 indicates no maximum value.<br/>

		Note: If the Hypervisor reaches its capacity, Jenkins will keep reissuing the agent commissioning until the capacity is below the threshold. Associated build jobs are thus delayed but not failed by a (presumably temporary) lack of agents.
